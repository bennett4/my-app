This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a duplicate of `.env.example`, rename it to `env.local`, and update the environment variables in the new file to their proper values.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This app is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard).

Production: https://my-app-bennett4.vercel.app/<br/>
Development: https://my-app-git-development-bennett4.vercel.app/

Each push to the respective branch (`main` and `development`) automatically kicks off a new build.
